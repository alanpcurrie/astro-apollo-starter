# Implement Astro for Static Site Generation

## Context We need a static site generator

that supports modern web development practices and integrates well with our existing
tech stack. Astro has been chosen for its performance benefits and its ability to
render static HTML from components written in various frameworks. ## Decision We
will use Astro as our static site generator for the new project. Astro allows us
to write components in our preferred framework while handling the complexities of
server-side rendering and hydration.

## Consequences

Improved load times due to static generation and partial hydration. - Increased developer productivity with
a component-based approach. - The need for the team to familiarize themselves with
Astro and its ecosystem.
